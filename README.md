# Automating-Whatsapp-Messaging
A code snippet to automate whatsapp messages in Python with pywhatkit.

pyautogui packages gets your screen resolution and takes cursor dimensions and hits enter

Note: pywhatkit just types in the message and does not actually send it

So, we use streamlit to send multiple messages all with the click of one button.

Note: Streamlit on cloud does not run graphing libraries like pyaoutogui :( yet.
